# DSPDecoder

`DSPDecoder` is a Python script for reading and decoding `.dsp` files generated by Thermo Fisher's VisionLiteâ„¢ software. These files typically store spectrophotometric absorbance data from UV-Vis instruments.

## Features

- Parses `.dsp` files from VisionLite.
- Extracts metadata (wavelength range, increment, etc.).
- Loads absorbance and wavelength values into NumPy arrays.
- export the spectral information as Pandas dataframe.
